The collocations folder includes a .py file with the function get_collocations and the create_collocations_venv.sh and requirements.txt.
The notebook folder includes a python notebook and the results dataframe. I used data from kaggle datasets https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews
which includes 130K wine reviews. I only used the first 10.000 though.
